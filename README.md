Open-source CLI-based solo trivia game made in [Python](https://www.python.org/) designed for those big-brained people that get sleepy on computer science classes because everything is so easy/so outdated they can't even afford to care about it.<br>
As this is a CLI-based game, it can be played kinda unnoticed by teachers (at least if you're on a computer science course), and you're going to learn more from this than whatever they're talking on class.

This game is powered by [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/) to get questions.

### How to play
Run the python script at `src/main.py`. This will make the game begin.<br>
Each run is **15** questions, the highest score you can get is `45,000` as you have to be very quick with your answers. Questions itself have no time and you can answer whenever you want (though you may not get points at all lol)
