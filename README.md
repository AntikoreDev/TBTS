# TBTS
_TBTS stands for TBTS better than school_

Open-source CLI-based solo trivia game made in [Python](https://www.python.org/) designed for those big-brained people that get sleepy on computer science classes because everything is so easy/so outdated they can't even afford to care about it.<br>
As this is a CLI-based game, it can be played kinda unnoticed by teachers (at least if you're on a computer science course), and you're going to learn more from this than whatever they're talking on class.

This game is powered by [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/) to get questions.

### How to play
Run the python script at `src/main.py`, this will start the game and send you to the main menu
